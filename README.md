The automatic plant watering system efficiently automates irrigation by using a soil moisture sensor to accurately gauge soil conditions and a relay module to control a water pump accordingly. The LCD display provides a user-friendly interface that updates in real time, informing the user of the current soil moisture status and the systemâ€™s actions. This solution not only conserves water by preventing unnecessary watering but also supports optimal plant health by ensuring that soil conditions are ideal for plant growth. Such systems are increasingly valuable in urban gardening, greenhouse operations, and for busy or absent caretakers, enhancing plant care through technology.
